# Matugen Integration
Basic integation of Matugen using swww for gtk3,gtk4,qt5ct,qt6ct,kde

# Setup
Copy the contents of the repo to `~/.config/matugen/`  
Or use this command  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexankitty/matugen-integration ~/.config/matugen
```

# Config
Set your Qt application style to qtct6-style.  
I recommend setting your icons and colors to Breeze Dark.
In your Qt6ct/Qt5ct config, set the application style to Breeze and the color scheme to matugen.
Install the [adw-gtk3](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use) theme otherwise the gtk3 colors will not work

# Note
Includes templates stolen from [InioX's matugen-themes](https://github.com/InioX/matugen-themes) repo.  
I made the KDE stuff work, but I'm not smart enough nor have the patience to do the others.  
Instructions on how to use the rest of the templates are on the matugen-themes repo.
