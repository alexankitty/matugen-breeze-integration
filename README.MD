# Matugen Breeze Integration
Basic integation of Matugen with the Breeze theme for gtk and qt.

# Setup
Copy the contents of the repo to `~/.config/matugen/`  
This will replace your gtk/qt configs, so make sure to back up gtk-3.0, gtk-4.0, qt5ct, and qt6ct folders in .config.

# Config
Set your Qt application style or QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME variable to qt6ct
I recommend setting your icons and colors to Breeze Dark.
In your Qt6ct/Qt5ct config, set the application style to Breeze and the color scheme to matugen.

# Note
Includes templates stolen from [InioX's matugen-themes](https://github.com/InioX/matugen-themes) repo.  
Instructions on how to use the rest of the templates are on the matugen-themes repo.
